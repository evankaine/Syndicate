She became Horizon\'s apprentice, and as part of "The Group" working on Project Iris, one of Pathfinder\'s creators. Through her work, she comes to know Darion Che and Eduardo Silva when they are kids running around the Peck Labs. However, she was secretly working with the Apex Predators to take the Branthium, and had infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. She departed with Horizon on a dangerous mission to prove the existence of Branthium. After successfully extracting the Branthium from a black hole, Reid betrayed Horizon and left her to die in the black hole. After betraying the rest of the Group on December 25, 2658 and trying to take all the Branthium for herself, she was stabbed by Amelie Paquette. However, contrary to what is known, she is merely mortally wounded, and at her request was made into a simulacrum.')

It was considered a bad omen, and when the pale blue eyes of Obi Edolasim opened, his community saw a cursed child. His parents did not; they loved him unconditionally because they saw the true empathic, creative soul of their son. They even supported him when he was drawn to the theatricality of the Arenas, where he could express himself fully. At first, the crowds felt unsure of him. But over time, with each victory, the power inside him grew, and with it, his strength in the Arena. And as his reputation began to precede him, a strange thing happened… The people in the crowd who were downtrodden, outcast, and forgotten—they saw themselves in Seer. Soon, throngs of people would come out just to see him fight—cheering Seer on as their champion. Now, this legend from the Arenas is making his way to the Apex Games and there isn’t a single soul who hasn’t already heard his name. The boy born under a bad omen and a terrible myth has taken this tale and created an even greater legend. He is Seer— an icon of the shunned, the unaccepted, and the unabashedly original.")

When she was a child, she stole a Titan. It belonged to her dad: callsign Viper. She wanted to be just like him when she grew up. But the next day he left on a mission and never returned. In some ways, she still followed in his footsteps: it wasn't a Titan, but her ship offered a decent living. Her personal life, however, was anything but. During the day, she smuggled precious cargo, and at night, went shot for shot with the outlaws and mercs in the bars. But even though she had her ladies, her liquor, and her love of the sky, she was still obsessed with finding the man who’d put her father in harm’s way: his commander, Kuben Blisk. She tracked Blisk down, prepared to kill him. But he spoke of her father with respect -- and challenged her to be better. She shot him anyway. But not to kill. Knowing she could get to him was enough. Well, that, and the Apex Games card she took from Blisk’s grasp. Using the intact flight core from Viper’s Northstar, she built a sleek new jetpack that honored her father’s memory. And that was when Kairi could finally soar on her own… and in a version of her dad’s Titan, a modified Northstar with an enhanced VTOL and flight core, that ended up being hers after all.")

He’s a blow-up-first ask-questions-later kinda guy, who’s always looking for a good scrap. Fuse grew up on Salvo--a brutal planet ruled by a rotating collection of misfit warlords bent on mayhem, murder, and good times. For most of his life, he worked as a mercenary alongside his childhood friend, Maggie. But while she aspired to become one of Salvo’s most powerful warlords, Fuse felt the pull of the arena. Fuse found his calling late in life-fighting in Salvo’s bloodsport: the Bonecage. He proved to be the best, most charismatic, and beloved gladiator on the planet. But he itched to join the grandest stage of them all: the Apex Games.

But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reid departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right. Mary promised her son Newton she’d return safe and sound. But Dr. Reid betrayed her, stealing the Branthium and sending her shuttle into the black hole’s orbit. Using her wits, Mary modified her robotic vacuum companion N.E.W.T. to escape. But time moves differently on the outskirts of a black hole, and she was 87 years too late. Now Mary is determined to fund her research to find a way to go back in time and be with her son. She joins the Apex Games as Horizon, master of gravity, just in time for the next season to debut on Olympus - where her old life once was and where she had promised to return.")

Parekh climbed to the top showcasing pure skill using her custom-modded gear. She began taking jobs from smugglers, Syndicate members, and everyone in between. Some say it ain't great unless it's got Rampart written on it. Parekh never shied away from letting people know how great she was, or better yet, how bad they were. Maybe that's what led a group of assailants to ambush her at her shop one night. Her business burned down and she was left with nothing -- except an Apex Card. For Parekh, the Apex card is more than just an invitation to compete - it's a sign that she may have lost her shop, but she didn't lose what built it.

With her new teleportation bracelet, the most secure and unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living the high life. Rumors spread across the Outlands: if you wanted something valuable -and well guarded- Loba's who you go to. She was almost able to put her past behind her. But when Revenant joined the Games, her past catapulted into her future. Desperate to find a way to kill him, she found out the truth about the Simulacrum with help from her friend Jaime and successfully sabotaged a facility full of Revenant bodies, bringing Skull Town and Thunderdome crashing down in the process. However, she learned it was just one of many such factories hidden across the Frontier. Now, she's joined the Games to find a way to end him for good. It doesn't hurt that the Arenas are brimming with treasures just waiting to be plucked. Revenge will come, if fortune favors her. In the meantime, some shiny things have caught her eye.")

The simulacrum Revenant first booted up in 2420, though it took another twenty years for the robotic shell to function properly, after which he was delivered to the Syndicate for their use. For three centuries Revenant has been an agent of death for the Syndicate, type the name of the target, and a day later they're dead. When Revenant himself dies, his masters resurrected him again and again, snatching him from death’s embrace and programming him to forget.But one day, after killing Marcos and Alanza Andrade, he looked at a mirror and finally saw himself for what he had become. He swore that he would hunt down every last person who did this to him, but more than two centuries have passed, and they're all gone… or so he thought. The return of Hammond Robotics to the Outlands has renewed his thirst for vengeance, he snuck into their facilities, trying to find out more about himself. When an interview with Forge, a Legend sponsored by Hammond, was conducted in World's Edge he went there and killed him. He wasn't the first nor would he be the last, for he won’t stop until anybody connected to Hammond is dead. Of course, he doesn’t mind eviscerating a few of the Legends along the way.

But two years ago, Tae Joon and Mila stumbled upon an algorithm that could predict the result of any Apex Games match, hidden away in the Games’ own computer systems. That caught the attention of the wrong people - the next day, Mila disappeared, and Tae Joon was forced into hiding after he was framed for her murder. With his reputation destroyed, and the Syndicate after him, he gave up his identity, his face, and his family in order to facilitate his redemption. Wanting to get closer to the people who framed him, Tae Joon planned to join the games but thought he wouldn't be able to pass the games' qualifiers.

She devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such a skilled engineer that she was commissioned by the Syndicate to build the Apex Games’ Modified Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her father died the day it was revealed, leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors invited her to return to the arena with them, assuring her she would always have a home.

He later recounted that day as the single greatest day in his life. As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his daredevil days were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help: Ajay Che, who he guilted into forging an order to replace his legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment’s notice, Octavio decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate adrenaline rush, the Apex Games, was calling.

While working as a bartender on the Paradise Lounge in Solace City to make some extra money, Mirage heard amazing stories from his patrons about the Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory.
